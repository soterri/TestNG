TestNG is an annotation base testing tool/framework

A testNG framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.

A framework is comprised of a combo of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently

TestNG is a tool seperate from Selenium.

Steps for creating the project:
We create a standard Java project
Add TestNG library into our project
We import Test annotation into our class
We execute the test cases with testNG Test
by default the test cases are executed alphabetically

The most important annotation of TestNG is @Test annotation. This is the real test case.

Before and After Annotation
Preconditions: open browser, navigate to URL
Postconditions: closing browser, generating report

When we start using Selenium we need to:
Add Selenium jar files
Add Common IO - maybe later
Copy chromedriver, geckodriver into drivers folder
Copy configuration.properties into configs folder
Create a new com.util package
Copy baseClass, CommonMethods, ConfigsReader, Constants into com.utils package
