A testNG framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.

A framework is comprised of a combo of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently

TestNG is a tool seperate from Selenium.

Steps for creating the project:
We create a standard Java project
Add TestNG library into our project
We import Test annotation into our class
We execute the test cases with testNG Test
by default the test cases are executed alphabetically

The most important annotation of TestNG is @Test annotation. This is the real test case.
